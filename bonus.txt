Q: What is Machine Learning?
A: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data.

Q: What's the difference between AI and ML?
A: AI is the broader concept; ML is a part of AI focused on learning from data.

Q: What is a Neural Network?
A: A Neural Network is a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.

Q: What is supervised learning?
A: It’s a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. Module 1 goes into this in detail: https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/machine-learning-with-python

Q: What is unsupervised learning?
A: Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labels to find patterns or structures.

Q: What is overfitting in machine learning?
A: Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new data.

Q: How does computer vision work?
A: Computer vision enables machines to interpret visual information from the world. It often uses CNNs (convolutional neural networks) to process image data.

Q: What is transfer learning?
A: Transfer learning uses a pre-trained model on one task to improve learning in another related task.

Q: Can you explain reinforcement learning?
A: Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML where an agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Q: What is a chatbot?
A: A chatbot is an AI system designed to simulate human conversation.

Q: What is Custom Vision in AI?
A: Custom Vision is a service by Microsoft Azure that lets you build, deploy, and improve image classifiers. It allows you to upload your own images, train a model, and then use that model to identify specific objects in new images. For more information here's a link to learn more about computer vision by IBM : https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/computer-vision

Q: How does Custom Vision differ from general image classification?
A: Unlike general image classifiers that are pre-trained for broad tasks, Custom Vision lets you train models on your own specific categories using custom-labeled images.

Q: Can I use Custom Vision without coding?
A: Yes! Custom Vision has a web interface where you can upload images, label them, and train models visually—no code needed.

Q: What types of projects can I build with Custom Vision?
A: Examples include detecting damaged products, recognizing logos, identifying plant diseases, or monitoring factory equipment using images.

Q: Can Custom Vision detect multiple objects in an image?
A: Yes, it supports object detection, not just classification. You can train it to locate and identify multiple objects in a single image.

Q: What export options does Custom Vision support?
A: You can export your trained model to run on mobile devices (iOS/Android), Edge devices, or use it via a REST API in the cloud.

Q: Is Custom Vision free?
A: It has a free tier with limited training and prediction hours. For more usage or better performance, you’ll need a paid Azure plan.

Q: Where can I start using Custom Vision?
A: Go to the official portal here: https://customvision.ai

Q: How is bias introduced in AI models?
A: Bias can be introduced through unbalanced or non-representative training data, as well as developer assumptions.

Q: What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
A: LLMs are advanced AI models trained on vast datasets capable of generating human-like text. GPT-4 is an example.

Q: How can I improve my understanding of AI?
A: Follow up with the bootcamp modules, join AI forums like Stack Overflow or Reddit’s r/MachineLearning, and check out YouTube channels like 3Blue1Brown or StatQuest.
